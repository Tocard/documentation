# Intro to data streams

:::tip Key Point:
A stream is simply a **sequence of data points in time**, i.e. an append only log. This is semantically equivalent to **topics** in traditional [pub/sub networks](main-concepts/pub-sub.md).

All of the data in the [Streamr network](main-concepts/streamr-network.md) is contained inside individual streams. The data may originate, for example from machines on the factory floor, sensors in a smart city, in-house databases or systems, or from commercial streaming data feeds.
:::

### Properties of a data stream

- Sequence of data points in time
- Any kind of **real-time data** can be stored in it.
- The data will always be **retrieved in the correct order**.
- The data is **persisted on the [Streamr network](main-concepts/streamr-network.md)** and **identifiable by unique ID**.

### Example data stream

Let's say you have a temperature measurement device that publishes the **temperature of your house every second**. Then this is how your data stream would look like:

| Timestamp               | Temperature |
| :---------------------- | :---------- |
| 2019-08-01 11:30:01.012 | 312.56      |
| 2019-08-01 11:30:02.239 | 312.49      |
| 2019-08-01 11:30:03.105 | 312.42      |
| 2019-08-01 11:30:04.122 | 312.64      |
| 2019-08-01 11:30:05.882 | 312.32      |

Your stream would grow over time and you can add more colums/data fields to your timestamp.

## Data fields

A field is a kind of placeholder for an individual piece of data, from a single data point (temperature in our example is _one_ data field). Each data point contains at least one data field, but you can have as many fields per data point as required.

### Data field types

:::info Good to know
Field types can be freely mixed in a single data point. And you can freely add new fields to an existing stream; you donâ€™t have to know what fields you might eventually need. **A single data point can be of any size within reason, and a stream can grow indefinitely when extended by new data points**.

<details><summary>Built in data types</summary>

**Number** is a numeric data type internally stored as a double precision (64-bit) float.

**Boolean** is a logical data type with two possible values, True and False. In Streamr, a numeric value exactly equal to one represents logical truth. Anything else is interpreted as a logical falsehood.

**String** is a sequence of zero or more alphabetical characters.

**Object** is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is a string, and the value can be of any built-in data type (even another object). Object is equivalent to Java's 'Map'.

**List** is an ordered collection of zero or more elements. List is equivilent to an array.

### Example for a data point

here's a data point in a stock market stream:

```json
{
  "Symbol": "PFFT",
  "EventType": 1,
  "OrderId": 6454321,
  "Direction": "Up",
  "Trade": { "Price": 118.55, "Size": 100 },
  "Ask": [
    { "Price": 118.6, "Size": 22500 },
    { "Price": 118.65, "Size": 18000 }
  ],
  "Bid": [
    { "Price": 118.5, "Size": 16500 },
    { "Price": 118.45, "Size": 11000 }
  ]
}
```

Given the structure of this data point, the stream's fields could be configured as follows:

| Field     | Field type |
| :-------- | :--------- |
| Symbol    | String     |
| EventType | Number     |
| OrderId   | Number     |
| Direction | String     |
| Trade     | Object     |
| Ask       | List       |
| Bid       | List       |
