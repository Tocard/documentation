# Stream partitioning

:::tip Key Point:
Partitioning (sharding) **enables streams to scale horizontally**.

Partitions can be understood as sub-streams, or in other words, parts of a stream.

Currently partitions donâ€™t have well-defined rate limits, but future versions of the P2P network may enforce limits. For now, we recommend not exceeding around 100 msg/sec/partition.
:::

For streams that need to handle large data rates, partitions are used for sharding of the data. Sharding data simply means **dividing a large volume of messages to multiple partitions.**

> _Think of it like a large river can split the same amount of water to multiple smaller branches._

Each partition **shares the general properties of the parent stream**, such as `name`, `description`, and `user permissions`.

However, the partitions **behave independently when it comes to delivering and storing data** in the Streamr Network, which allows for scalability.

:::info good to know:
When messages are published to a stream, they are actually published to a partition within that stream. One partition per stream is the default, which is sufficient for streams with moderate rates of data (approx. less than 100 msg/sec).

### Why partition a stream

Partitions enable subscribers to **scale horizontally**: a user consuming data from a stream could **load balance the messages** over a number of consuming processes, up to the number of partitions.

So if a stream has 5 partitions, the user could start up to 5 independent subscribers on separate physical machines, with each subscriber receiving different messages (each process subscribes to a unique partition).

## Create partitioned streams

Create new partions if your messages **extend approx. 100 msg/sec per partition**

By default, streams only have 1 partition when they are created. The partition count can be set to any number between 1 and 100. An example of creating a partitioned stream:

```js
// Requires MATIC tokens (Polygon blockchain gas token)
const stream = await streamr.createStream({
  id: `/foo/bar`,
  partitions: 10,
});
console.log(
  `Stream created: ${stream.id}. It has ${
    stream.getMetadata().partitions
  } partitions.`
);
```

:::note

The client generally supports the following **three ways of defining a stream id**:

```js
// Stream id as a string:
const streamId = `${address}/foo/bar`;

// Stream id + partition as a string
const streamId = `${address}/foo/bar#4`;

// Stream id + partition as an object
const streamId = {
  id: `${address}/foo/bar`,
  partition: 4,
};
```

## Publish to partitioned streams

In most use cases, a user wants **related messages (e.g. messages from a particular device) to be assigned to the same partition**, so that the messages retain a deterministic order and reach the same subscriber(s) to allow them to compute stateful aggregates correctly.

If no partition is specified, the **data goes to partition 0 by default**.

You can specify the partition number as follows:

```js
await streamr.publish(
  {
    id: `${address}/foo/bar`,
    partition: 4,
  },
  msg
);
```

### Add partition keys

A common approach is to utilize a `partition key`. A `partition key` is **a value chosen from the data** which is used to determine the partition of the message.

For example a customer ID could be used as a `partition key` in an application that publishes customer interactions to a stream. In an IoT use case, the device id can be used as `partition key`.

**The same `partition key` always maps to the same partition.**

This way, **all messages from a particular customer always go to the same partition.** This is useful because it keeps all the events related to a particular customer in a single and known partition instead of spreading them over all partitions.

The `partition key` can be given as an argument to the `publish` methods, and the library assigns a deterministic partition number automatically:

```js
await stream.publish(msg, {
  partitionKey: msg.vehicleId,
});
```

## Subscribe to partitioned streams

By default, the client subscribes to the first partition (partition `0`) of a stream.

Be aware: this behavior will change in the future so that it will subscribe to _all_ partitions by default.

The partition number can be explicitly given in `subscribe`:

```js
const sub = await streamr.subscribe(
  {
    id: streamId,
    partition: 4,
  },
  (content) => {
    console.log('Got message %o', content);
  }
);
```

#### subscribe to multiple partitions:

```js
const onMessage = (content, streamMessage) => {
  console.log(
    'Got message %o from partition %d',
    content,
    streamMessage.getStreamPartition()
  );
};

await Promise.all(
  [2, 3, 4].map(async (partition) => {
    await streamr.subscribe(
      {
        id: streamId,
        partition,
      },
      onMessage
    );
  })
);
```
