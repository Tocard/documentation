# What is the Streamr Network
The Streamr Network is a peer-to-peer network for publishing and subscribing to data in real-time. Applications use it for _decentralized messaging_, for example sharing data across applications or broadcasting information to large audiences. The decentralized nature of the system makes the data transport scalable, robust, secure, tamper proof, and censorship resistant.

The Streamr Network consists of _nodes_ that interconnect peer-to-peer using the Streamr protocol. Together, the nodes in the Network form a topic-based publish-subscribe messaging system. Topics in this messaging system are called streams. The job of the Network is to deliver published streams of messages to all subscribers of that stream.

The Streamr Network is a building block for decentralized applications - a message transport middleware, enabling any number of parties to distribute or exchange information without directly coupling or relying on a central server to broker data. Read more about various use cases.

## Network Explorer
The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://streamr.network/network-explorer">Network Explorer</a> is an application that brings visibility to the stream topologies inside the Streamr Network.

The network is highly dynamic, with a regular cast of broker nodes, but also a constantly revolving number of light nodes appearing and disappearing. Being able to explore it helps node runners inspect their nodes and diagnose any issues.

### Node search
You can search for areas, say all nodes in Helsinki, streams by path name or description, as well as specific nodes by generated name or Ethereum address.

### Stream topology exploration
By searching or selecting a stream, the nodes participating in the stream overlay will be shown in both the results list, and on the geo map. Selecting a node in this list gives you access to all the metrics, and as the full tokenomics rolls out in Tatum milestone, will also give access to the nodeâ€™s Ethereum address, and link out to its transaction history on Etherscan.

## Further reading
Most readers of these docs will seek information about _using_ the Streamr Network in their applications. To understand _how_ the Network and nodes actually work under the hood, the technicalities are discussed at length in the the Network page. A stylish nutshell representation of the Network is available on the Network page of the project website.
