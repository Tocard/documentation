### What is pub/sub?

:::tip Key Point:
Understand what is pub/sub, why do businesses require Pub/Sub, and the advantages of Pub/Sub compared to similar technologies. Also, learn about core Pub/Sub concepts that include the terms topic, publisher, and subscriber.
:::

Pub/sub, short for publish/subscribe, is a messaging pattern that allows for the asynchronous and scablable communication of components in a distributed system.

Publishers are components that send messages to the message broker. These messages are typically sent to a specific topic, which is a channel for communication. The message broker then distributes the messages to subscribers who subscribe to that topic.

Subscribers are components that are interested in receiving messages from one or more topics. They can choose to subscribe to multiple issues, allowing them to receive a wide range of messages.
