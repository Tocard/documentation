# Welcome to the Streamr Docs repo!

## Content updates
At the bottom of every content page is a link to edit the markdown file on GitHub called, "Edit this page". Simply edit the raw contents and submit a pull request to have the change reviewed before it is implemented.

## Deployment (Streamr Dev only)
To deploy structural changes to the [documentation](https://docs.streamr.network), simply push a tagged release. Ensure that the tag begins with a letter.   
e.g. `git tag v1.13` & `git push origin v1.13`.
